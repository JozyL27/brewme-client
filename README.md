# BrewMe!

As a user:

I can add beers to "My Beers". Beers contain:

ABV info
the name of the beer
a description of the beer

I can see a list of my beers when I click on the "My Beers" feature

All beers in the list show their abv, description, and name info by default

I can click the delete button to remove a beer from "My Beers" list

I can use the search feature to find a beer in the beer database

I can use the "Add to my beers" button to add a beer to "My Beers" list

I can use the "Random Beer" feature to retrieve a random beer from the beer database

I receive appropriate feedback when I cannot add a beer to the beer database
